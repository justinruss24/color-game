# color-game
In this project, a random RGB color code is generated as the game starts. 

There is an easy mode (3 options), and a hard mode (6 options).

The player must guess which color block is represented by the RBG color code.

If guessed incorrectly, the clicked color block disappears, leaving one less choice for the player.

Once the correct color is selected that matches the RGB code, all the color blocks are populated with the winning color, and the player is asked
if they would like to play again.
